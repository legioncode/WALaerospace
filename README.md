# Space Freight by WAL :rocket:

In Space Freight we find solutions for assignment of parcels to spacecrafts for transport to the International Space Station (ISS). This is a typical Constraint Optimization Problem (COP): there are multiple possible solutions, which are not necessarily all as good, and which have to meet certain requirements i.e. constraints. Depending on the constraints, solutions can be optimized based on the following outcomes:

> 1: The amount of packages that can be transported\
> 2: The costs of the transport
