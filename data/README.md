# Data

This folder contains the data we have available to run this project's code with, all formatted as csv files. The cargolists contain parcels which all have an id, mass and volume. The spacecraft lists contain spacecrafts and define the nation, payload, volume, mass, basecost and fuel-to-weight ratio of each spacecraft. Code to import these files can be found under ***'code/helperfunctions/readers.py'***. Find below some characteristics of our data:
