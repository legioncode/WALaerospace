# Results UPS

UPS is a random algorithm which takes in three arguments: a list of the available spacecrafts, a list of the parcels to be assigned and the n amount of times to run. Parcels are assigned randomly to spacecrafts, but only if there is actually room left for the parcel. If the algorithm is runned more than one time, the best solution will be returned. A short summary of the outcomes of UPS with n = 10.000:

> Parcellist 1 \
> Packages: 86\
> Costs: $1.464.516.936,44

> Parcellist 2 \
> Packages: 78\
> Costs: $1.465.741.490,35

Output files' names end with the number of the used parcellist.
